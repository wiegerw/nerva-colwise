	abstract     = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer’s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.}

The authors base their approach on differentials rather than derivatives, and they show that the use of differentials is elegant, easy and considerably more useful in applications. No specialist knowledge of matrix algebra or calculus is required, since the basics of matrix algebra are covered in the first three chapters with a thorough treatment of multivariable calculus provided in Chapters Four to Seven. Exercises are included in each chapter, and many examples which illustrate applications of the theory are considered in detail.},

It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.}

However, it is incapable of classifying linearly inseparable patterns. A new era of neural network research started in 1986, when the backpropagation (BP) algorithm was rediscovered for training the multilayer perceptron (MLP) model. An MLP with a large number of hidden nodes can function as a universal approximator. To date, the MLP model is the most fundamental and important neural network model. It is also the most investigated neural network model. Even in this AI or deep learning era, the MLP is still among the few most investigated and used neural network models. Numerous new results have been obtained in the past three decades. This survey paper gives a comprehensive and state-of-the-art introduction to the perceptron model, with emphasis on learning, generalization, model selection and fault tolerance. The role of the perceptron model in the deep learning era is also described. This paper provides a concluding survey of perceptron learning, and it covers all the major achievements in the past seven decades. It also serves a tutorial for perceptron learning.}

  abstract = {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multi-layer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future.  We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1.  Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.},

    abstract = "{Evaluating the log-sum-exp function or the softmax function is a key step in many modern data science algorithms, notably in inference and classification. Because of the exponentials that these functions contain, the evaluation is prone to overflow and underflow, especially in low-precision arithmetic. Software implementations commonly use alternative formulas that avoid overflow and reduce the chance of harmful underflow, employing a shift or another rewriting. Although mathematically equivalent, these variants behave differently in floating-point arithmetic and shifting can introduce subtractive cancellation. We give rounding error analyses of different evaluation algorithms and interpret the error bounds using condition numbers for the functions. We conclude, based on the analysis and numerical experiments, that the shifted formulas are of similar accuracy to the unshifted ones, so can safely be used, but that a division-free variant of softmax can suffer from loss of accuracy.}",

ABSTRACT = {In the age of artificial intelligence, the best approach to handling huge amounts of data is a tremendously motivating and hard problem. Among machine learning models, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is not only simple but also very effective. This study provides a detailed analysis of contemporary state-of-the-art deep learning applications, such as natural language processing (NLP), visual data processing, and voice and audio processing. Following that, this study introduces several versions of SGD and its variant, which are already in the PyTorch optimizer, including SGD, Adagrad, adadelta, RMSprop, Adam, AdamW, and so on. Finally, we propose theoretical conditions under which these methods are applicable and discover that there is still a gap between theoretical conditions under which the algorithms converge and practical applications, and how to bridge this gap is a question for the future.},
